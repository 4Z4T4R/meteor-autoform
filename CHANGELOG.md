AutoForm
=========================

AutoForm is a smart package for Meteor that adds handlebars helpers to easily create basic
forms with automatic insert and update events, and automatic reactive validation. 

## Change Log

### 0.3.2

Fix IE<10 errors

### 0.3.1

Fixes to date inputs

### 0.3.0

Updated to work with 0.2.0 versions of collection2 and simple-schema packages. The autoform features should be backwards-compatible, but the collection2 and simple-schema APIs have changed, so you may need to make changes. To make sure everything works as you expect, it's strongly recommended that you include a unique `id` attribute on every `autoForm` helper.

### 0.2.3

* Fix IE<10 issue

### 0.2.2

* Use `submit form` event handler instead of button click handlers
* Add support for binding an `onSubmit` handler to an autoForm using the `onSubmit` helper attribute.
* Don't include `form-control` class on radio buttons and check boxes
* Submit the form normally after validating if none of the special actions are used

### 0.2.1

Fix input helper to use value passed in `value` attribute if no doc is attached to the autoform.

### 0.2.0

* For autoforms that call a server method, server-side validation is no longer performed automatically. This had to be removed to fix a security issue. After updating to 0.2.0, you must call `check()` in the Meteor method.
* Add `formToDoc` and `docToForm` functions. See the readme.
* Improve keyup validation
* Allow direct binding of Collection2 or AutoForm object to autoForm helper through the schema attribute. Passing in the string name of a global object is still supported, but binding is the preferred method now.
